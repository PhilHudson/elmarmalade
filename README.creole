Reimplementing the marmalade-repo with Elnode.

marmalade is written in node.js right now.  It's also a bit of a mess.

I want to reimplement marmalade using [[http://elnode.org|Elnode]].

marmalade uses mongo-db as a data store.

This code is an attempt to reimplement marmalade-repo with an Elnode
layer on top of the existing mongo database.
