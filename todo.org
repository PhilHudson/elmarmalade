* elmarmalade-package-archives
** needs an ALL query
*** needs to be everything
** needs rendering to what archive-contents looks like
** what's the correct mime type to send
*** ngrep a transaction

* elmarmalade-package
** abstract elnode-docroot-for over elnode db?
** what does the package download look like?

* elmarmalade-handler
** add the user facing front end stuff
*** login
*** register
*** upload
**** this should be particularly simple
**** is there a standard for this in package-x or something?
